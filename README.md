# Analytics of Placements at NMAMIT

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the placement activities at NMAMIT, Nitte, using data visualization techniques in R programming. The main goal is to provide insights into the placement trends and opportunities offered by various companies over the past three years. This analysis is intended to assist students and stakeholders in understanding the placement landscape at NMAMIT.

## Objectives

- To collect data related to placement drives at NMAMIT.
- To segregate the collected data into relevant sub-topics.
- To implement data visualization techniques using R packages.
- To demonstrate the functionality of various R packages in data visualization.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data related to placement activities at NMAMIT, including details of companies and job offers.
2. **Data Segregation**: Organized data into relevant categories for analysis.
3. **Data Implementation**: Used CSV files to implement the data and utilized various R packages for visualization.
4. **Visualization**: Created graphs and charts using R packages like `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`, `ggpubr`, `ggrepel`, and `ggsci` to visually represent the data.

## Implementation Details

The data visualization was implemented using the following R packages:

- **ggplot2**: For creating complex plots from data frames.
- **Tidyverse**: Includes tools for data manipulation and visualization.
- **ggpubr**: Simplifies the creation of ggplot2-based graphs for users with non-advanced programming backgrounds.
- **ggrepel**: Helps avoid overlapping text labels in ggplot2 visualizations.
- **ggsci**: Provides scientific journal-inspired color palettes for ggplot2.

## Results

The analysis covered placement data for the academic years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22, highlighting key statistics such as:

- **2019-20**: The Computer Science and Engineering branch had the highest placements, with Accenture offering the most jobs.
- **2020-21**: DXC Technology was a significant recruiter, and a total of 1176 jobs were offered by 90 companies.
- **2021-22**: Cognizant was the top recruiter, and Computer Science and Engineering continued to lead in placements.

## Conclusion and Future Scope

The project successfully visualized the placement trends at NMAMIT, showing variations in placements and internships over the years. The insights gained from this analysis can help future students and the institution better understand placement dynamics and prepare accordingly.
